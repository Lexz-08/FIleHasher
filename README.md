## FIleHasher
### Description
Can compute the hash sum of files ***VERY QUICKLY***.

### Download
[FIleHasher.exe](https://github.com/Lexz-08/FIleHasher/releases/download/hasher/FIleHasher.exe)

---

### How To Use
  1. You'll be prompted to enter a file path the second you launch the program.
  2. Enter the file path of the program you'd like to compute the MD5 HASH code of.
  3. If you want to hash `FIleHasher.exe` (the program you're currently using) for some reason, just type 1 of the 3 things: `this`, `.`, or, ` `.<br>
  I coded the program to automatically calculate the MD5 HASH code of itself if you type that because I'm lazy.
  4. A `BackgroundWorker` will be ran asynchronously and it will show the progress of the hash computation.
  5. Once it reaches ***100%***, which will happen very quickly, it will display the hash code of the file.

### To Copy the Hash Code
  1. Click and hold your cursor at the end of the computed hash code.
  2. Drag your cursor to the beginning of the computed hash code.
  3. Do the system-default hotkey `Ctrl+C` to copy the code, and paste it into `Notepad` or something for use for later if you want.
